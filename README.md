# DLA growing mechnism
This repository contains code and example for growing DLA-based artificial crystals over natural images.

## Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)
Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together 
to form aggregates of such particles. This theory is applicable to aggregation in any system where diffusion is the primary 
means of transport in the system. DLA can be observed in many systems such as electrodeposition, Hele-Shaw flow,
mineral deposits, and dielectric breakdown. For more information see:
